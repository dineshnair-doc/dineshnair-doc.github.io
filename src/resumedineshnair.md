## About Me

Technical writer focused on enhancing product value through clear, actionable documentation that drives user action and understanding.

My approach is hands-on, actively working with the product, as demonstrated by the screenshots and practical examples featured in my [recent work](my_writings.md){target="_blank"}. I translate complex tech into clear narratives that empower users and drive sales. I am here to make your product's brilliance shine by visually demonstrating its use with practical examples, rather than simply describing it.

I have a good understanding of the Docs as Code workflow, including writing documentation in Visual Studio Code, managing version control with Git, hosting on GitHub, and publishing using a static site generator. 

Looking for a remote work opportunity in India or an in-office role in Hyderabad, India. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dineshn1/){target="_blank"} or reach out to me through email at [techwriterdinesh@protonmail.com](mailto:techwriterdinesh@protonmail.com).
