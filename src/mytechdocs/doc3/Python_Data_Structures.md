# Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets in Python
In this document, we'll explore fundamental data structures in Python: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. 

## Lists

A list can store multiples values. It's written with square brackets \[ \].

Lists are ordered, changeable, and can contain duplicate items.

Here's a list:

```python
a_list = ["Jason", True, "Vishal", "Vishal", 211]
print (a_list)
```

Run the code and you'll see this output:

![List displayed as ordered and with duplicates](lists1.png)

### Access List Item

List items are ordered and accessed through their index number. Index number starts from 0.

The following code is printing the second item in the list. Each item can be accessed through the index number.

```python
departments = ["Finance", "Administration", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering"]
print (departments[1])
```

Output:

![Second list item displayed](lists2.png)

### Change List Item

This code is changing the second item to *Legal*:

```python
departments = ["Finance", "Administration", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering"]
departments[1] = "Legal"
print (departments)
```

Output:

![Second list item changed](lists3.png)

### Add or Remove List Item

This code is using the *append* method to add an item to the list:

```python
departments = ["Finance", "Administration", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering"]
departments.append("Procurement")
print (departments)
```

Output:

![List items displayed including the appended one](lists4.png)

To remove an item from the list, you can use the *remove* method. For example: `colors.remove(‚Äúgreen‚Äù)`*.*

### Sort List Items

This code is sorting the list in ascending alphabetical order:

```python
departments = ["Finance", "Administration", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering"]
departments.sort()
print (departments)
```

Output:

![List items displayed in ascending alphabetical order](lists5.png)

## Dictionaries

A dictionary stores items in *key: value* format. Keys must be unique, although values can be duplicates. Dictionary items are ordered and changeable.

Dictionary is written with curly brackets { }.

Here's a dictionary:

```python
a_dict = {
    "integer": 112,
    "boolean": True,
    "string": "Jane",
    "duplicate_int": 112,
}
print(a_dict)
```

Run the code and you'll see this output:

![Dictionary items displayed in key-value format](dict1.png)

### Get a Dictionary Value

This code prints the value for the key *Fred*:

```python
teacher_subject = {
    "Jaya": "Cellular biology",
    "Shriya": "Chemistry",
    "Jane": "Genetics",
    "Fred": "Physics",
    "John": "Astronomy",
}
print(teacher_subject ["Fred"])
```

Output:

![Value displayed is Physics](dict2.png)

Alternatively, you can use the *get* method to get the value:

```python
teacher_subject = {
    "Jaya": "Cellular biology",
    "Shriya": "Chemistry",
    "Jane": "Genetics",
    "Fred": "Physics",
    "John": "Astronomy",
}
print(teacher_subject.get("Fred"))
```

### Change a Dictionary Value

This code changes the value for the key *Jaya*:

```python
teacher_subject = {
    "Jaya": "Cellular biology",
    "Shriya": "Chemistry",
    "Jane": "Genetics",
    "Fred": "Physics",
    "John": "Astronomy",
}
teacher_subject ["Jaya"] = "Immunology"
print(teacher_subject)
```

Output:

![Dictionary items displayed with the changed subject](dict3.png)

### Add a Dictionary Item

This can be done by adding a new key and its value:

```python
teacher_subject = {
    "Jaya": "Cellular biology",
    "Shriya": "Chemistry",
    "Jane": "Genetics",
}
teacher_subject ["Sujith"] = "Biochemistry"
print(teacher_subject)
```

Output:

![Dictionary items displayed including the added item](dict4.png)

### Remove a Dictionary Item

This can be done by using the *pop* method:

```python
teacher_subject = {
    "Jaya": "Cellular biology",
    "Shriya": "Chemistry",
    "Jane": "Genetics",
    "Sujith": "Biochemistry",
}
print(teacher_subject) #print before removal
teacher_subject.pop("Sujith")
print(teacher_subject) #print after removal
```

Output:

![Dictionary items displayed before and after removal](dict5.png)

## Tuples

A tuple, like a list variable, can store multiple items. In a list, you can add, remove, and modify items. In contrast, once a tuple is created, you cannot change items in the tuple or add or remove items.

Tuples are generally faster than list because of their read-only nature.

Tuple is written with parenthesis ( ) and can contain duplicates.

Here's a tuple:

```python
a_tuple = (211, "Anita", True, 3.14, 211) 
print(a_tuple)
```

Run the code and you'll see this output:

![Tuple items displayed including duplicates](tup1.png)

### Access a Tuple Item

Tuple items are ordered, and you can access them using an index number.

This code will print the fourth item in the tuple:

```python
departments = ("Finance", "Administration", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering")
print (departments[3])
```

Output:

![Fourth tuple item displayed](tup2.png)

### Access a Range of Tuple Items

You can access a range of tuple items by using a colon.

This code selects the items from 1 to 3 index numbers:

```python
departments = ("Finance", "Admin", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering", "Legal")
print (departments[1:4])
```

> üí° **Tip:** Note that with <code>[1:4]</code>, the selection starts at the start index and goes up to but doesn't include the end index. That means it includes indices 1, 2, and 3 but doesn't include 4.

Output:

![Admin, IT, Marketing displayed](tup3.png)

This code selects items from *Marketing* to the end:

```python
departments = ("Finance", "Admin", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering", "Legal")
print (departments[3:])
```

Output:

![Marketing, Engineering, Legal displayed](tup4.png)

This code selects items from the beginning to *IT*:

```python
departments = ("Finance", "Admin", "IT", "Marketing", "Engineering", "Legal")
print (departments[:3])
```

> üí° **Tip:** It includes start index (which is 0) but doesn't include end index (which is 3).

Output:

![Finance, Admin, IT, displayed](tup5.png)

## Sets

A set can also have multiple items, but they cannot be duplicates. You cannot change the set items but can add or remove items.

A set is written with curly brackets { }.

Here's a set:

```python
a_set = {"Jane", 311, 7.14, True}
print(a_set)
```

When I run the code, I get this output:

![Items displayed are in a different order](set1.png)

Sets are unordered. So, again when I run the code, the order of items changes.

![Different order, again](set2.png)

### Add or Remove a Set Item

This code adds an item using the *add* method:

```python
departments = {"Finance", "Engineering", "IT", "Marketing"}
departments.add("Quality Control")
print (departments)
```

Output:

![Set items displayed](set3.png)

To remove an item from a set, you can use the *remove* method. For example: `colors.remove(‚Äúgreen‚Äù)`.

### Join Sets

Use the | operator to join sets:

```python
departments_set1 = {"Finance", "Engineering"}
departments_set2 = {"Marketing", "Legal"}
departments_set3 = {"Procurement", "Logistics"}
combined_set = departments_set1 | departments_set2 | departments_set3
print (combined_set)
```

Output:

![Combined set items displayed](set4.png)

### Difference

You can use the *difference* method to return only those items in the first set that aren't there in the other set.

In this code, the *difference* method will return *Legal* and *IT* that aren't there in the other set:

```python
departments_set1 = {"Finance", "Marketing", "Legal", "IT"}
departments_set2 = {"Finance", "Logistics", "Marketing"}
set3 = departments_set1.difference(departments_set2)
print (set3)
```

Output:

![Legal, IT set items displayed](set5.png)

### Difference Update

You can use *difference\_update* method to retain only those items in the first set that aren't there in the other set.

In this code, the *difference\_update* method updates first set with *Legal* and *IT*:

```python
departments_set1 = {"Finance", "Marketing", "Legal", "IT"}
departments_set2 = {"Finance", "Logistics", "Marketing"}
departments_set1.difference_update(departments_set2)
print (departments_set1)
```

Output:

![Updated first set items displayed](set6.png)

### Symmetric Difference

You can use *symmetric\_difference* method to return items that are in one of the sets but not in both:

```python
departments_set1 = {"Finance", "Marketing", "Legal", "IT"}
departments_set2 = {"Finance", "Logistics", "Marketing"}
set3 = departments_set1.symmetric_difference(departments_set2)
print (set3)
```

Output:

![Legal, IT, Logistics set items displayed](set7.png)

## Convert One Data Structure into Another

There could be use cases where you want to convert one data structure into another. Let's cover few such cases.

### List to a Tuple

For example, to make the data unchangeable, you might want to convert a list to a tuple:

```python
a_list = ["Astronomy", 211, 71.1, "History"]
print (a_list)
a_tuple = tuple(a_list)
print (a_tuple)
```

Output:

![List and tuple items displayed](conv1.png)

### List to a Set

For example, to remove duplicates, you might want to convert a list to a set:

```python
a_list = ["Astronomy", 211, 71.1, "History", "History", 211]
print (a_list)
a_set = set(a_list)
print (a_set)
```

Output:

![Set items displayed with duplicates removed](conv2.png)

### Dictionary to a Tuple

For example, to have the *key: value* items become unchangeable, you might want to convert a dictionary to a tuple:

```python
a_dict = {"Astronomy": 1, "History": 2}
print (a_dict)
a_tuple = tuple(a_dict.items())
print (a_tuple)
```

Output:

![Dictionary and tuple items displayed](conv3.png)

### Tuple to a List

For example, to add an item, you might want to convert a tuple to a list:

```python
a_tuple = ("Astronomy", "History", 211, 312)
print (a_tuple)
a_list = list(a_tuple)
a_list.append("Philosophy")
print (a_list)
```

Output:

![List items including added item displayed](conv4.png)

In this document, we've looked at the data structures in Python: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. Each of these data structures has unique features. Lists provide ordered, changeable data; dictionaries provide key-value pair storage; tuples provide unchangeable data; and sets provide unique, unordered data.
